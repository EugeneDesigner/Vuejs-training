# Description

Using the **vue-cli**, I decided to follow the [Time Tracking tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-single-page-time-tracking-app-with-vue-js-part-ii) and build my first Vue.js app. Feels nice, and good enough to start my own project.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
